## V8 isolates

agentOS uses V8 isolates (the same engine behind Node.js, Chromium, and Cloudflare Workers) to run JavaScript and TypeScript workloads. Isolates provide near-native execution speed with strong memory isolation between actors. Each actor gets its own isolate with no shared state.

## WebAssembly kernel

The kernel is a WebAssembly module that provides a POSIX-like interface to the V8 isolate. It manages:

- **Process table.** Each process (shell command, script, agent session) runs as its own WebAssembly instance coordinated by the kernel. Processes are isolated from each other.
- **Virtual filesystem.** A unified filesystem abstraction backed by pluggable drivers (in-memory, SQLite VFS, S3, host directories).
- **Virtual network.** Outbound requests are proxied through the host with configurable controls. No direct host network access.

## Process isolation

Every process spawned inside the VM gets its own WebAssembly instance. This means:

- A runaway process cannot corrupt another process's memory
- Each process has its own stack and heap
- The kernel mediates all IPC and filesystem access between processes

## Runtimes

Three runtimes mount into the kernel:

- **WebAssembly** for POSIX utilities (coreutils, grep, sed, etc.)
- **V8 isolate** for JavaScript/TypeScript agent code
- **Pyodide** for Python workloads with kernel-backed I/O
