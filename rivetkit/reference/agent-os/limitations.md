> Description: What the agentOS VM does not support, and how to work around it.

---
agentOS is a hybrid model. The lightweight VM handles most agent workloads (coding, scripting, file I/O, API calls) with near-zero overhead. When a workload hits a VM limitation, agents can escalate to a full [sandbox](/docs/agent-os/sandbox) on demand without changing code. The two share a filesystem, so files written in the VM are available in the sandbox and vice versa.

See [agentOS vs Sandbox](/docs/agent-os/versus-sandbox) for a detailed comparison.

## No native Linux binaries

agentOS runs JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and shell commands. Native x86/ARM binaries compiled for Linux cannot run directly.

- Precompiled CLI tools (e.g. `docker`, `kubectl`, `terraform`)
- Native language runtimes (Go, Rust, C++ binaries)
- System packages installed via `apt` or `yum`

## No real Linux kernel

The VM uses a virtual kernel. System calls that require a real Linux kernel are not available.

- Raw sockets and custom network protocols
- Kernel modules and eBPF
- Container runtimes (Docker-in-Docker)
- Low-level filesystem operations (inotify, fuse)

## No hardware access

The VM has no access to GPUs, USB devices, or other hardware.

- GPU-accelerated ML inference
- Hardware-dependent testing
