# Queue Messages

> Description: Send durable messages to Rivet Actors and optionally wait for completion.

---
Rivet Actors include a pull-based queue for durable message processing. Clients enqueue messages, and actors pull them with `c.queue.next()`.

Queues are durable: messages persist until the actor acknowledges them. When `wait: true`, the actor must call `msg.complete()` to remove the message.

## Send Messages (Client)

Fire-and-forget sends a message and returns immediately:

```typescript @nocheck
const handle = client.myActor.getOrCreate(["orders"]);

await handle.queue.tasks.send({ id: "order-123" });
```

To wait for the actor to finish processing:

```typescript @nocheck
const result = await handle.queue.tasks.send(
  { id: "order-123" },
  { wait: true, timeout: 30_000 }
);

if (result.status === "completed") {
  console.log(result.response);
} else {
  console.log("timed out");
}
```

## Receive Messages (Actor)

Actors pull messages with `c.queue.next()`:

```typescript @nocheck
const msg = await c.queue.next("tasks");
if (!msg) return;

// Process the message...
```

Each message includes a stable `id` string you can log or correlate across systems.

Use `wait: true` to hold the message until you explicitly complete it:

```typescript @nocheck
const msg = await c.queue.next("tasks", { wait: true });
if (!msg) return;

// Process the message...
await msg.complete();
```

You can also send data back to the waiting client:

```typescript @nocheck
await msg.complete({ result: "ok" });
```

## Manual Completion

When `wait: true`, the message is marked in-flight and remains persisted until completion. Calling `msg.complete()` removes the message and resolves any waiting client.

If `wait: false`, calling `msg.complete()` throws `QueueCompleteNotAllowed`.

If a client sends with `wait: true` but the actor receives without `wait: true`, the message auto-completes and the waiting client receives `{ status: \"completed\", response: undefined }`.

## Persistence & Redelivery

- Messages persist until `msg.complete()` is called.
- In-flight state persists across restarts.
- If the actor crashes before completion, the message is redelivered with exponential backoff.
- Completion responses are not persisted and are only delivered to waiting clients.

Backoff schedule:

- 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, ... (capped at 5 minutes)

Messages are retried indefinitely. There is no forced timeout on the actor side.

## Error Handling

- `QueueCompleteNotAllowed`: `msg.complete()` called when `wait: false`.
- `QueueMessagePending`: `c.queue.next()` called while a previous `wait: true` message is still pending.
- `QueueAlreadyCompleted`: `msg.complete()` called more than once.

If a message remains pending for more than 30 seconds, the actor logs a warning but does not time out automatically.

## HTTP API

Use the vanilla HTTP API to enqueue messages:

```
POST /queue/:name
Body: { body: { ... } }
Response: { status: "completed" }
```

Wait for completion:

```
POST /queue/:name
Body: { body: { ... }, wait: true, timeout: 30000 }
Response: { status: "completed", response: { ... } }
```

Timeouts still return HTTP 200:

```
{ status: "timedOut" }
```

## Examples

### Fire-and-forget

```typescript @nocheck
await handle.queue.emails.send({ to: "user@example.com" });
```

### Request-response

```typescript @nocheck
// Client
const result = await handle.queue.work.send(
  { input: "value" },
  { wait: true, timeout: 10_000 }
);

// Actor
const msg = await c.queue.next("work", { wait: true });
if (msg) {
  const output = doWork(msg.body);
  await msg.complete({ output });
}
```
