> Description: Use embedded SQLite in Rivet Actors with raw SQL queries.

---
For a high-level overview of where to store actor data, including when to use `c.state` versus SQLite, see [State & Storage](/docs/actors/state). For a worked multi-tenant pattern, see the cookbook: [Database per Tenant](/cookbook/per-tenant-database/).

## What is SQLite?

- **Database per actor**: each actor instance has its own SQLite database, scoped to that actor.
- **High performance**: Rivet Actors keep compute and storage together, so queries avoid network round trips to an external database.
- **Larger-than-memory storage**: SQLite stores data on disk, so you can work with datasets that do not fit in actor memory.
- **Embedded relational database**: use tables, indexes, and SQL queries directly inside actor logic.

### SQLite features

- **Indexes**: speed up lookups on frequently queried fields.
- **Search and filtering**: use `WHERE`, `LIKE`, and `ORDER BY` instead of manual in-memory loops.
- **Relationships**: use multiple tables and `JOIN` queries for connected data.
- **Constraints**: use primary keys, unique constraints, and foreign keys for data integrity.
- **Transactions**: apply multiple writes atomically when changes must stay consistent.

## Raw SQL vs ORM (Drizzle)

Rivet supports both raw SQL and [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) for actor-local SQLite.

Use **raw SQL** when you want direct query control and minimal abstraction.

```ts @nocheck
await c.db.execute("INSERT INTO todos (title) VALUES (?)", title);
const rows = await c.db.execute("SELECT id, title FROM todos ORDER BY id DESC");
```

Use **Drizzle** when you want typed schema and typed query APIs.

```ts @nocheck
await c.vars.drizzle.insert(todos).values({ title });
const rows = await c.vars.drizzle.select().from(todos).orderBy(desc(todos.id));
```

You can mix both in the same actor.

For Drizzle setup, see [SQLite + Drizzle](/docs/actors/sqlite-drizzle).

## Basic setup

Define `db: db({ onMigrate })` on your actor, create your schema in `onMigrate`, and execute SQL with `c.db.execute(...)`.

RivetKit wraps `onMigrate` in a SQLite savepoint, so migration steps are atomic. If `onMigrate` throws, all SQL run by that hook is rolled back before the actor starts.

## Queries

`c.db.execute(...)` returns an array of row objects for `SELECT` queries.

```ts @nocheck
const rows = await c.db.execute(
  "SELECT id, title FROM todos WHERE title LIKE ?",
  `%${query}%`,
);
```

### Parameterized queries

Use `?` placeholders for dynamic values and pass parameters in order after the SQL string.

```ts @nocheck
await c.db.execute("INSERT INTO todos (title) VALUES (?)", title);
```

You can also use named SQLite bindings by passing a single properties object.

```ts @nocheck
const rows = await c.db.execute(
  "SELECT id, title FROM todos WHERE title = :title",
  { title: "Write SQLite docs" },
);
```

### Transactions

Use transactions when multiple writes must succeed or fail together.

- Start with `BEGIN`.
- End with `COMMIT` if all queries succeed.
- On error, run `ROLLBACK` and rethrow.
- A transaction is global for the entire shared `c.db` connection. Be careful with other interleaved queries.

```ts @nocheck
await c.db.execute("BEGIN");

try {
  await c.db.execute("INSERT INTO todos (title) VALUES (?)", title);
  await c.db.execute(
    "INSERT INTO comments (todo_id, body) VALUES (last_insert_rowid(), ?)",
    body,
  );
  await c.db.execute("COMMIT");
} catch (error) {
  await c.db.execute("ROLLBACK");
  throw error;
}
```

## Queues

It's recommended to use queues for mutations and actions for read-only queries. This is the same code structure as the basic setup, but mutation writes are routed through queues.

## Debugging

- `GET /inspector/summary` includes `isDatabaseEnabled` so you can confirm SQLite is configured.
- `GET /inspector/database/schema` returns the tables and views discovered in the actor's SQLite database.
- `GET /inspector/database/rows?table=...&limit=100&offset=0` returns paged rows for a specific table or view.
- `POST /inspector/database/execute` lets you run ad-hoc SQL for debugging and data fixes with positional `args` or named `properties`.
- Keep a small read-only action for quick query verification while debugging.
- In non-dev mode, inspector endpoints require authorization.

## Recommendations

- Keep schema creation and migration steps in `onMigrate`; RivetKit runs them atomically inside a SQLite savepoint.
- Use `?` placeholders for dynamic values.
- Prefer queue-driven writes for ordered or background work.
- Use transactions for related multi-step mutations when atomicity matters.
