# Architecture

> Description: How the client, sandbox, server, and agent fit together.

---
Sandbox Agent runs as an HTTP server inside your sandbox. Your app talks to it remotely.

## Components

- `Your client`: your app code using the `sandbox-agent` SDK.
- `Sandbox`: isolated runtime (E2B, Daytona, Docker, etc.).
- `Sandbox Agent server`: process inside the sandbox exposing HTTP transport.
- `Agent`: Claude/Codex/OpenCode/Amp process managed by Sandbox Agent.

  SERVER["Sandbox Agent server"]
  AGENT["Agent process"]

  subgraph SANDBOX["Sandbox"]
    direction TB
    SERVER --> AGENT
  end

  CLIENT -->|HTTP| SERVER
```

## Suggested Topology

Run the SDK on your backend, then call it from your frontend.

This extra hop is recommended because it keeps auth/token logic on the backend and makes persistence simpler.

```mermaid placement="top-right"

  BROWSER["Browser"]
  subgraph BACKEND["Your backend"]
    direction TB
    SDK["Sandbox Agent SDK"]
  end
  subgraph SANDBOX_SIMPLE["Sandbox"]
    SERVER_SIMPLE["Sandbox Agent server"]
  end

  BROWSER --> BACKEND
  BACKEND --> SDK --> SERVER_SIMPLE
```

### Backend requirements

Your backend layer needs to handle:

- **Long-running connections**: prompts can take minutes.
- **Session affinity**: follow-up messages must reach the same session.
- **State between requests**: session metadata and event history must persist across requests.
- **Graceful recovery**: sessions should resume after backend restarts.

We recommend [Rivet](https://rivet.dev) over serverless because actors natively support the long-lived connections, session routing, and state persistence that agent workloads require.

## Session persistence

For storage driver options and replay behavior, see [Persisting Sessions](/session-persistence).
