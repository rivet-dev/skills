# Telemetry

> Source: `docs/telemetry.mdx`

> Description: Anonymous telemetry collected by sandbox-agent.

---
sandbox-agent sends a small, anonymous telemetry payload on startup and then every 5 minutes to help us understand usage and improve reliability.

## What gets sent

- Sandbox Agent version.
- OS name, architecture, and OS family.
- Detected sandbox provider (for example: Docker, E2B, Vercel Sandboxes).

Each sandbox gets a random anonymous ID stored on disk so usage can be counted without identifying users.
The last successful send time is also stored on disk, and heartbeats are rate-limited to at most one every 5 minutes.

## Opting out

Telemetry is enabled by default in release builds.

Disable it with:

```bash
sandbox-agent server --no-telemetry
```
