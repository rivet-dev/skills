> Description: Status of the OpenCode bridge during ACP v2 migration.

---
OpenCode compatibility is intentionally deferred during ACP core migration.

## Current status (v2 core phases)

- `/opencode/*` routes are disabled.
- `sandbox-agent opencode` returns an explicit disabled error.
- This is expected while ACP runtime, SDK, and inspector migration is completed.

## Planned re-enable step

OpenCode support is restored in a dedicated phase after ACP core is stable:

1. Reintroduce `/opencode/*` routing on top of ACP internals.
2. Add dedicated OpenCode ↔ ACP integration tests.
3. Re-enable OpenCode docs and operational guidance.
