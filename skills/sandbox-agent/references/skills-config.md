---
Skills are local instruction bundles stored in `SKILL.md` files. Sandbox Agent can fetch, discover, and link skill directories into agent-specific skill paths at session start using the `skills.sources` field. The format is fully compatible with [skills.sh](https://skills.sh).

## Session Config

Pass `skills.sources` when creating a session to load skills from GitHub repos, local paths, or git URLs.

```ts TypeScript
import { SandboxAgentClient } from "sandbox-agent";

const client = new SandboxAgentClient({
  baseUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:2468",
  token: process.env.SANDBOX_TOKEN,
  agent: "mock",
  });

await client.createSession("claude-skills", {
  agent: "claude",
  skills: {
    sources: [
      { type: "github", source: "rivet-dev/skills", skills: ["sandbox-agent"] },
      { type: "local", source: "/workspace/my-custom-skill" },
    ],
  },
});
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:2468/v1/sessions/claude-skills" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SANDBOX_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent": "claude",
    "skills": {
      "sources": [
        { "type": "github", "source": "rivet-dev/skills", "skills": ["sandbox-agent"] },
        { "type": "local", "source": "/workspace/my-custom-skill" }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

Each skill directory must contain `SKILL.md`. See [Skill authoring best practices](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices) for tips on writing effective skills.

## Skill Sources

Each entry in `skills.sources` describes where to find skills. Three source types are supported:

| Type | `source` value | Example |
|------|---------------|---------|
| `github` | `owner/repo` | `"rivet-dev/skills"` |
| `local` | Filesystem path | `"/workspace/my-skill"` |
| `git` | Git clone URL | `"https://git.example.com/skills.git"` |

### Optional fields

- **`skills`** — Array of skill directory names to include. When omitted, all discovered skills are installed.
- **`ref`** — Branch, tag, or commit to check out (default: HEAD). Applies to `github` and `git` types.
- **`subpath`** — Subdirectory within the repo to search for skills.

## Custom Skills

To write, upload, and configure your own skills inside the sandbox, see [Custom Tools](/custom-tools).

## Advanced

### Discovery logic

After resolving a source to a local directory (cloning if needed), Sandbox Agent discovers skills by:
1. Checking if the directory itself contains `SKILL.md`.
2. Scanning `skills/` subdirectory for child directories containing `SKILL.md`.
3. Scanning immediate children of the directory for `SKILL.md`.

Discovered skills are symlinked into project-local skill roots (`.claude/skills/<name>`, `.agents/skills/<name>`, `.opencode/skill/<name>`).

### Caching

GitHub sources are downloaded as zip archives and git sources are cloned to `~/.sandbox-agent/skills-cache/` and updated on subsequent session creations. GitHub sources do not require `git` to be installed.
