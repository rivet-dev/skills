## Open the Inspector

Visit [inspect.sandboxagent.dev](https://inspect.sandboxagent.dev) and enter your server URL and token to connect.

You can also generate a pre-filled Inspector URL from the TypeScript SDK:

```typescript
import { buildInspectorUrl } from "sandbox-agent";

const url = buildInspectorUrl({
  baseUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:2468",
  token: process.env.SANDBOX_TOKEN,
});
console.log(url);
// https://inspect.sandboxagent.dev?url=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A2468&token=...
```

## Features

- **Session list**: View all active sessions and their status
- **Event stream**: See events in real-time as they arrive (SSE or polling)
- **Event details**: Expand any event to see its full JSON payload
- **Send messages**: Post messages to a session directly from the UI
- **Agent selection**: Switch between agents and modes
- **Request log**: View raw HTTP requests and responses for debugging

## When to Use

The Inspector is useful for:

- **Development**: Test your integration without writing client code
- **Debugging**: Inspect event payloads and timing issues
- **Learning**: Understand how agents respond to different prompts
