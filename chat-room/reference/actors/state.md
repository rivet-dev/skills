> Description: Choose where to store data in your actors: in-memory state for small serializable values, embedded SQLite for large or queryable data, and ephemeral variables for connections to external databases and non-serializable runtime objects.

---
Actors give you several places to store data. Choosing the right one keeps your actor fast, durable, and easy to reason about.

## Choosing Where to Store Data

| Need | Use |
|---|---|
| Small, simple, serializable values (counters, flags, a small map) | `c.state` |
| Large / relational / queryable / durable data | SQLite (`c.db`) — see [SQLite docs](/docs/actors/sqlite) |
| Data in an external database, or non-serializable runtime objects (connections, clients, emitters) | `createVars` / `c.vars` |

In-memory state (`c.state`) is the simplest option and the right default for small amounts of data. As soon as your data grows large, becomes relational, or needs to be queried, reach for [SQLite](/docs/actors/sqlite) instead. Use [ephemeral variables](#ephemeral-variables) (`c.vars`) for runtime-only objects like database clients or for loading data from an external database.

## In-Memory State

Actor state provides the best of both worlds: it's stored in-memory and persisted automatically. This lets you work with the data without added latency while still surviving crashes and upgrades.

In-memory state is meant for **small, simple values** such as counters, flags, or a small map. When your data grows large or needs querying, use [SQLite](#sqlite) instead.

### Initializing State

There are two ways to define an actor's initial state:

### Static Initial State

Define an actor state as a constant value:

```typescript
import { actor } from "rivetkit";

// Simple state with a constant
const counter = actor({
  // Define state as a constant
  state: { count: 0 },

  actions: {
    // ...
  }
});
```

This value will be cloned for every new actor using `structuredClone`.

### Dynamic Initial State

Create actor state dynamically on each actors' creation:

```typescript
import { actor } from "rivetkit";

// State with initialization logic
const counter = actor({
  // Define state using a creation function
  createState: () => {
    return { count: 0 };
  },

  actions: {
    // ...
  }
});
```

To accept a custom input parameters for the initial state, use:

```typescript
import { actor } from "rivetkit";

interface CounterInput {
  startingCount: number;
}

interface CounterState {
  count: number;
}

// State with initialization logic
const counter = actor({
  state: { count: 0 } as CounterState,
  // Define state using a creation function
  createState: (c, input: CounterInput): CounterState => {
    return { count: input.startingCount };
  },

  actions: {
    increment: (c) => c.state.count++
  }
});
```

Read more about [input parameters](/docs/actors/input) here.

If accepting arguments to `createState`, you **must** define the types: `createState(c: CreateContext, input: MyType)`

Otherwise, the return type will not be inferred and `c.state` will be of type `unknown`.

The `createState` function is called once when the actor is first created. See [Lifecycle](/docs/actors/lifecycle) for more details.

### Modifying State

To update state, modify the `state` property on the context object (`c.state`) in your actions:

```typescript
import { actor } from "rivetkit";

const counter = actor({
  state: { count: 0 },

  actions: {
    // Define action to update state
    increment: (c) => {
      // Update state, this will automatically be persisted
      c.state.count += 1;
      return c.state.count;
    },

    add: (c, value: number) => {
      c.state.count += value;
      return c.state.count;
    }
  }
});
```

Only state stored in the `state` object will be persisted. Any other variables or properties outside of this are not persisted.

### State Saves

Actors automatically handle persisting state transparently. This happens at the end of every action if the state has changed. State is also automatically saved after `onFetch` and `onWebSocket` handlers finish executing.

For `onWebSocket` handlers specifically, you'll need to manually save state using `c.saveState()` while the WebSocket connection is open if you want state changes to be persisted immediately. This is because WebSocket connections can remain open for extended periods, and state changes made during event handlers (like `message` events) won't be automatically saved until the connection closes.

In other cases where you need to force a state change mid-action, you can use `c.saveState()`. This should only be used if your action makes an important state change that needs to be persisted before the action completes.

#### Immediate vs Throttled Saves

`c.saveState()` supports two modes:

- **`c.saveState({ immediate: true })`** saves state to storage right away. `await` resolves once the write completes. Use this when you need to guarantee persistence before continuing (e.g. before a risky async operation).
- **`c.saveState()`** (without `immediate: true`) schedules a throttled save. `await` will not resolve until the next flush cycle, which can take up to `stateSaveInterval` (default: 10 seconds). This batches rapid state changes to reduce write frequency, but means the caller blocks until the flush fires.

If you want to save state promptly during a WebSocket message handler, use `immediate: true`.

```typescript
import { actor } from "rivetkit";

// Mock risky operation
async function someRiskyOperation() {
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
}

const criticalProcess = actor({
  state: {
    steps: [] as string[],
    currentStep: 0
  },

  actions: {
    processStep: async (c) => {
      // Update to current step
      c.state.currentStep += 1;
      c.state.steps.push(`Started step ${c.state.currentStep}`);

      // Force save state before the async operation
      await c.saveState({ immediate: true });

      // Long-running operation that might fail
      await someRiskyOperation();

      // Update state again
      c.state.steps.push(`Completed step ${c.state.currentStep}`);

      return c.state.currentStep;
    }
  }
});
```

### State Isolation

Each actor's state is completely isolated, meaning it cannot be accessed directly by other actors or clients.

To interact with an actor's state, you must use [Actions](/docs/actors/actions). Actions provide a controlled way to read from and write to the state.

If you need a shared state between multiple actors, see [sharing and joining state](/docs/actors/sharing-and-joining-state).

### Type Limitations

State is currently constrained to the following types:

- `null`
- `undefined`
- `boolean`
- `string`
- `number`
- `BigInt`
- `Date`
- `RegExp`
- `Error`
- Typed arrays (`Uint8Array`, `Int8Array`, `Float32Array`, etc.)
- `Map`
- `Set`
- `Array`
- Plain objects

## SQLite

For data that is large, relational, queryable, or larger than memory, use the embedded SQLite database available on `c.db`.

Each actor instance has its own SQLite database, scoped to that actor. Because Rivet Actors keep compute and storage together, queries avoid network round trips to an external database. SQLite stores data on disk, so you can work with datasets that do not fit in actor memory, and you get a full relational engine with tables, indexes, `JOIN`s, constraints, and transactions.

For complete documentation, see:

- [SQLite](/docs/actors/sqlite) — raw SQL queries against the embedded per-actor database.
- [SQLite + Drizzle](/docs/actors/sqlite-drizzle) — typed schema and query APIs with the Drizzle ORM.

## Ephemeral Variables

In addition to persisted state, actors can store ephemeral data that is not saved to permanent storage using `vars`. This is useful for temporary data that only needs to exist while the actor is running, non-serializable objects like database connections or event emitters, and loading initial data from an external database.

`vars` is designed to complement `state`, not replace it. Most actors that need it will use both: `state` for critical business data and `vars` for ephemeral or non-serializable data.

### Initializing Variables

There are two ways to define an actor's initial vars:

### Static Initial Variables

Define an actor vars as a constant value:

```typescript
import { actor } from "rivetkit";

// Mock event emitter for demonstration
interface EventEmitter {
  on: (event: string, callback: (data: unknown) => void) => void;
  emit: (event: string, data: unknown) => void;
}

function createEventEmitter(): EventEmitter {
  const listeners: Record<string, ((data: unknown) => void)[]> = {};
  return {
    on: (event, callback) => {
      listeners[event] = listeners[event] || [];
      listeners[event].push(callback);
    },
    emit: (event, data) => {
      listeners[event]?.forEach(cb => cb(data));
    }
  };
}

// Define vars as a constant
const counter = actor({
  state: { count: 0 },

  // Define ephemeral variables
  vars: {
    lastAccessTime: 0,
    emitter: createEventEmitter()
  },

  actions: {
    increment: (c) => ++c.state.count
  }
});
```

This value will be cloned for every new actor using `structuredClone`.

### Dynamic Initial Variables

Create actor vars dynamically on each actors' start. Unlike `createState`, which runs only once when the actor is first created, `createVars` runs every time the actor starts. This makes it the right place to open a database client or connection and load initial data from an external source:

```typescript
import { actor } from "rivetkit";

// Mock event emitter for demonstration
interface EventEmitter {
  on: (event: string, callback: (data: unknown) => void) => void;
  emit: (event: string, data: unknown) => void;
}

function createEventEmitter(): EventEmitter {
  const listeners: Record<string, ((data: unknown) => void)[]> = {};
  return {
    on: (event, callback) => {
      listeners[event] = listeners[event] || [];
      listeners[event].push(callback);
    },
    emit: (event, data) => {
      listeners[event]?.forEach(cb => cb(data));
    }
  };
}

// Define vars with initialization logic
const counter = actor({
  state: { count: 0 },

  // Define vars using a creation function
  createVars: () => {
    return {
      lastAccessTime: Date.now(),
      emitter: createEventEmitter()
    };
  },

  actions: {
    increment: (c) => ++c.state.count
  }
});
```

If accepting arguments to `createVars`, you **must** define the types: `createVars(c: CreateVarsContext, driver: any)`

Otherwise, the return type will not be inferred and `c.vars` will be of type `unknown`.

### Using Variables

Vars can be accessed and modified through the context object with `c.vars`:

```typescript
import { actor } from "rivetkit";

// Mock event emitter for demonstration
interface EventEmitter {
  on: (event: string, callback: (data: number) => void) => void;
  emit: (event: string, data: number) => void;
}

function createEventEmitter(): EventEmitter {
  const listeners: Record<string, ((data: number) => void)[]> = {};
  return {
    on: (event, callback) => {
      listeners[event] = listeners[event] || [];
      listeners[event].push(callback);
    },
    emit: (event, data) => {
      listeners[event]?.forEach(cb => cb(data));
    }
  };
}

const counter = actor({
  // Persistent state - saved to storage
  state: { count: 0 },

  // Create ephemeral objects that won't be serialized
  createVars: () => {
    // Create an event emitter (can't be serialized)
    const emitter = createEventEmitter();

    // Set up event listener directly in createVars
    emitter.on('count-changed', (newCount) => {
      console.log(`Count changed to: ${newCount}`);
    });

    return { emitter };
  },

  actions: {
    increment: (c) => {
      // Update persistent state
      c.state.count += 1;

      // Use non-serializable emitter
      c.vars.emitter.emit('count-changed', c.state.count);

      return c.state.count;
    }
  }
});
```

### Connecting to External Databases

Because `createVars` runs on every actor start, it's the natural place to open a connection to an external database such as Postgres or Redis and load any data your actor needs. The connection lives only in memory and is never serialized:

```typescript @nocheck
import { actor } from "rivetkit";
import { Pool } from "pg";

const userActor = actor({
  state: { profile: null as Record<string, unknown> | null },

  // Open a connection to the external database and load initial data on every start
  createVars: async (c) => {
    const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
    const result = await pool.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1", [c.key[0]]);
    return { pool, profile: result.rows[0] };
  },

  actions: {
    updateEmail: async (c, email: string) => {
      await c.vars.pool.query("UPDATE users SET email = $1 WHERE id = $2", [email, c.key[0]]);
    }
  }
});
```

Use this pattern when your source of truth lives in an external database. For data owned entirely by the actor, prefer [in-memory state](#in-memory-state) or [SQLite](#sqlite), which require no external infrastructure.

### When to Use `vars` vs `state`

In practice, most actors that need both will use them together: `state` for critical business data and `vars` for ephemeral or non-serializable data.

Use `vars` when:

- You need to store temporary data that doesn't need to survive restarts.
- You need to maintain runtime-only references that can't be serialized (database connections, event emitters, class instances, etc.).
- You need to load data from or write through to an external database.

Use `state` when:

- The data must be preserved across actor sleeps, restarts, updates, or crashes.
- The information is essential to the actor's core functionality and business logic.

## Debugging

- `GET /inspector/state` returns the actor's current persisted state and `isStateEnabled`.
- `PATCH /inspector/state` lets you set state directly while debugging.
- In non-dev mode, inspector endpoints require authorization.
