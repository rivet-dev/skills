# Runtime Modes

> Source: `src/content/docs/general/runtime-modes.mdx`

> Description: RivetKit supports two runtime modes for running your actors:

---
- **Serverless**: Default mode. Responds to HTTP requests and scales automatically.
- **Runners**: Background processes without HTTP endpoints. Only needed for advanced scenarios.

## Serverless

Serverless is the default and recommended mode. Rivet sends HTTP requests to your backend to run actor logic, allowing your infrastructure to scale automatically.

### Benefits

- **Platform support**: Works with serverless platforms (Vercel, Cloudflare Workers, etc.)
- **Scale to zero**: No cost when idle
- **Edge deployments**: Easier to deploy to edge locations
- **Preview deployments**: Integrates with preview deployments on platforms like Vercel and Railway
- **Efficient autoscaling**: Request-based autoscaling can be faster and more efficient than CPU-based autoscaling depending on the platform

### Example

```typescript {{"title":"Direct"}}
import { actor, setup } from "rivetkit";

const myActor = actor({ state: {}, actions: {} });
const registry = setup({ use: { myActor } });

export default registry.serve();
```

```typescript {{"title":"With Router"}}
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { actor, setup } from "rivetkit";

const myActor = actor({ state: {}, actions: {} });
const registry = setup({ use: { myActor } });

const app = new Hono();
app.all("/api/rivet/*", (c) => registry.handler(c.req.raw));

export default app;
```

See [Server Setup](/docs/general/http-server/) for more configuration options.

### Architecture

When a client creates an actor, it sends a request to the Rivet Engine. The engine then calls `GET /api/rivet/start` on your serverless backend to run the actor.

### Advanced

#### Endpoints

Rivet exposes the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/rivet/metadata`: Validates configuration
- `GET /api/rivet/start`: Runs an actor

You should never call these endpoints yourself, this is included purely for comprehension of how Rivet works under the hood.

#### Timeouts

Serverless platforms like Vercel have function timeouts. Rivet handles this automatically by migrating actors between function invocations, preserving state through `ctx.state`. Write your code as if it runs forever, Rivet handles the rest.

Read more about [how we handle timeouts](/blog/2025-10-20-how-we-built-websocket-servers-for-vercel-functions/#timeouts-and-failover).

## Runners

Runners run actors as long-running background processes without exposing an HTTP endpoint.

### When to Use Runners

- **No HTTP server**: Your app does not or cannot expose an HTTP server
- **No load balancer**: You don't have a load balancer to distribute HTTP requests across your servers
- **Custom scaling**: You have custom scaling requirements

### Example

```typescript {{"title":"runner.ts"}}
import { actor, setup } from "rivetkit";

const myActor = actor({ state: {}, actions: {} });
const registry = setup({ use: { myActor } });

registry.startRunner();
```

The runner runs in the background, ready to run actors.

### Architecture

On startup, your backend calls `registry.startRunner()` which opens a persistent connection to the Rivet Engine. When a client creates an actor, the engine sends a command through this connection to start the actor on your backend.

### Configuration

#### Runner Pool

Use `RIVET_RUNNER` to assign runners to a pool. This lets you control which runners handle specific actors.

```bash
RIVET_RUNNER=gpu-workers
```

```typescript
import { actor, setup } from "rivetkit";

const myActor = actor({ state: {}, actions: {} });

const registry = setup({
  use: { myActor },
  runner: {
    runnerName: "gpu-workers",
  },
});
```

#### Runner Key

Use `RIVET_RUNNER_KEY` to uniquely identify a runner. If another runner connects with the same key, the previous one is disconnected. This handles zombie runners that weren't shut down gracefully.

```bash
RIVET_RUNNER_KEY=worker-abc123
```

```typescript
import { actor, setup } from "rivetkit";

const myActor = actor({ state: {}, actions: {} });

const registry = setup({
  use: { myActor },
  runner: {
    runnerKey: "worker-abc123",
  },
});
```

  Generate a unique runner key using: `uuidgen` or `openssl rand -hex 16`

## Comparison

| Mode | Method | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|
| Serverless | `registry.serve()` | Default, recommended for most deployments |
| Serverless | `registry.handler()` | Integrating with existing routers (Hono, Elysia, etc.) |
| Runner | `registry.startRunner()` | Long-running processes without HTTP endpoints |
