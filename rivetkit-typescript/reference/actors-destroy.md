# Destroying Actors

> Source: `src/content/docs/actors/destroy.mdx`
> Canonical URL: https://rivet.gg/docs/actors/destroy
> Description: Actors can be permanently destroyed. Common use cases include:

---
- User account deletion
- Ending a user session
- Closing a room or game
- Cleaning up temporary resources
- GDPR/compliance data removal

Actors sleep when idle, so destruction is only needed to permanently remove data — not to save compute.

## Destroying An Actor

### Destroy via Action

To destroy an actor, use `c.destroy()` like this:

```typescript
import { actor } from "rivetkit";

interface UserInput {
  email: string;
  name: string;
}

const userActor = actor({
  createState: (c, input: UserInput) => ({
    email: input.email,
    name: input.name,
  }),
  actions: {
    deleteAccount: (c) => {
      c.destroy();
    },
  },
});
```

### Destroy via HTTP

Send a DELETE request to destroy an actor. This requires an admin token for authentication.

```typescript
const actorId = "your-actor-id";
const namespace = "default";
const token = "your-admin-token";

await fetch(`https://api.rivet.dev/actors/${actorId}?namespace=${namespace}`, {
  method: "DELETE",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
});
```

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.rivet.dev/actors/{actorId}?namespace={namespace}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

	Creating admin tokens is currently not supported on Rivet Cloud. See the [tracking issue](https://github.com/rivet-dev/rivet/issues/3530).

### Destroy via Dashboard

To destroy an actor via the dashboard, navigate to the actor and press the red "X" in the top right.

## Lifecycle Hook

Once destroyed, the `onDestroy` hook will be called. This can be used to clean up resources related to the actor. For example:

```typescript
import { actor } from "rivetkit";

interface UserState {
  email: string;
  name: string;
}

// Example email service interface
const emailService = {
  send: async (options: { from: string; to: string; subject: string; text: string }) => {},
};

const userActor = actor({
  state: { email: "", name: "" } as UserState,
  onDestroy: async (c) => {
    await emailService.send({
      from: "noreply@example.com",
      to: c.state.email,
      subject: "Account Deleted",
      text: `Goodbye ${c.state.name}, your account has been deleted.`,
    });
  },
  actions: {
    deleteAccount: (c) => {
      c.destroy();
    },
  },
});
```

## Accessing Actor After Destroy

Once an actor is destroyed, any subsequent requests to it will return an `actor_not_found` error. The actor's state is permanently deleted.
