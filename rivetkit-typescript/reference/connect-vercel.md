## Steps

### Prerequisites

- [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/)
- Your RivetKit app
  - If you don't have one, see the [Quickstart](/docs/actors/quickstart) page or our [Examples](https://github.com/rivet-dev/rivet/tree/main/examples)
- Access to the [Rivet Cloud](https://dashboard.rivet.dev/) or a [self-hosted Rivet Engine](/docs/general/self-hosting)

### Prepare Your Application

Make sure your project is configured correctly for Vercel deployment.

### Next.js

Your Next.js project should have the following structure:

- `src/app/api/rivet/[...all]/route.ts`: RivetKit route handler
- `src/actors.ts`: Actor definitions and registry

See the [Next.js quickstart](/docs/actors/quickstart/next-js) or the [Next.js template](/templates/next-js) to get started.

### Hono

Your Hono project needs:

1. A `vercel.json` file with the Hono framework specified:

```json {{"title":"vercel.json"}}
{
  "framework": "hono"
}
```

2. Your server file must import from `"hono"` for Vercel to recognize the framework:

```ts src/server.ts @nocheck
// You MUST import from "hono" for Vercel to detect this as a Hono app
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { registry } from "./actors.ts";

const app = new Hono();
app.all("/api/rivet/*", (c) => registry.handler(c.req.raw));
export default app;
```

3. Use `.ts` file extensions in imports and configure your `tsconfig.json`:

```json {{"title":"tsconfig.json"}}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowImportingTsExtensions": true,
    "rewriteRelativeImportExtensions": true
  }
}
```

See the [Hello World template](/templates/hello-world) for a complete example.

For more details on Hono deployments, see [Vercel's Hono documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/backend/hono).

### Other

Vercel currently supports Next.js and Hono frameworks for RivetKit deployments.

For other frameworks, consider deploying to [Railway](/docs/connect/railway), [Kubernetes](/docs/connect/kubernetes), or another platform.

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Connect your GitHub project to Vercel
2. Select your repository containing your RivetKit app
3. Vercel will deploy your app

More information on deployments are available in [Vercel's docs](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments).

### Connect and Verify

1. Visit the [Rivet dashboard](https://dashboard.rivet.dev)
2. Navigate to _Connect > Vercel_
3. Skip to the _Deploy to Vercel_ step
4. Input your deployed Vercel site URL
	- e.g. `https://my-app.vercel.app/api/rivet`
5. Once it shows as successfully connected, click _Done_

Your Vercel Functions deployment is now connected to Rivet.
